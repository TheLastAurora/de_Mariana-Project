Economic stability, welfare policies, and consensus-building contribute to the overall governance framework. This section addresses the following themes:</div><br>

# **FREEDOM**

<div style="text-align: justify">Freedom is appraised through civil and political rights, market dynamics, and societal traditions. Civil liberties, market competition, and protection of property rights and private enterprise are integral considerations. The evaluation also encompasses gender disparities, the legal system's role in shaping freedom, and the ease of doing business. Assessments of monetary and fiscal policies, trade regulations, labor market dynamics, and World Governance Indicators contribute to a holistic understanding of a nation's freedom landscape.</div><br>
